> ### Next.js + SWR codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the spec and API.

Originally created for this [GH issue]. The codebase is now feature complete; please submit bug fixes via pull requests & feedback via issues.

We're currently working on some docs for the codebase (explaining where functionality is located, how it works, etc) but most things should be self explanatory if you have a minimal understanding of Next.js/SWR.

## Getting started

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the local server
